# ArchiveThrust

ArchiveThrust allows a user to obtain a maneuver history of satellites. It is a command-line application that prompts the user for a satellite identification number (NORAD ID) and their login credentials for Space-Track. The program then returns a list of the most recent maneuvers of the selected satellite. These maneuvers are computed by downloading TLE data archives and applying known algorithms to detect such maneuvers.

# Installation
This installation guide is specifically tailored for Fedora and Ubuntu; it has not been tested on other systems. However, it can be used as a reference or example for other Linux distributions or Windows/MacOS with appropriate adaptations if you wish. To install the application, you need to install the external C/Python libraries with the code below.

For Fedora:
```
sudo dnf install libcurl-devel gsl-devel blas-devel python3-tkinter
```
For Ubuntu:
```
sudo apt install libcurl4-openssl-dev libgsl-dev libatlas-base-dev python3-tk
```

Second, clone the repository in the repository where you want to store ArchiveThrust.
```
git clone https://github.com/elephantshrews/ArchiveThrust.git
```
Third, navigate into the folder and install:
```
pipx install .
```
For that, of course, pipx needs to be installed on the machine, just like Python3.
# Configure 
You will need to set the following environment variables in your login file to run ArchiveThrust. Please copy the forms as they appear here and only change the username and password to your real username and password.

- ST_USERNAME for the space-track.org username (of the form ST_LOGIN="username")
- ST_PASSWORD for the space-track.org password (of the form ST_PASSWORD="password")


# Usage
To use ArchiveThrust, run `ArchiveThrust` from a command prompt after installing the software. The program will ask you for your for a NORAD ID. The software will then return recent satellite manoeuvres.
