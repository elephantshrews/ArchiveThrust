# ArchiveThrust

ArchiveThrust allows a user to obtain a maneuver history of satellites. It is a command-line application that prompts the user for a satellite identification number (NORAD ID) and their login credentials for Space-Track.

These maneuvers are computed by downloading TLE data archives and applying known algorithms to detect such maneuvers.
